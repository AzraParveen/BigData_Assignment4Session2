Hadoop in Layman's term:

HDFS>
HDFS takes care of storage part of Hadoop applications. MapReduce applications consume data 
from HDFS. HDFS creates multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes them on compute nodes
in cluster. This distribution enables reliable and extremely rapid computations.
               
MAP REDUCE>
MapReduce is a computational model and software framework for writing applications which are 
run on Hadoop. These MapReduce programs are capable of processing enormous data in parallel on
large clusters of computation nodes.

|> Hive - is data warehousing software that addresses how data is structured and queried in 
distributed Hadoop clusters. Hive is also a popular development environment that is used to 
write queries for data in the Hadoop environment. It provides tools for ETL operations and 
brings some SQL-like capabilities to the environment. Hive is a declarative language that is
used to develop applications for the Hadoop environment, however it does not support real-time 
queries.
Hive also allows MapReduce-compatible mapping and reduction software to perform more sophisticated
functions. However, Hive does not allow row-level updates or support for real-time queries, and it
is not intended for OLTP workloads. Many consider Hive to be much more effective for processing 
structured data than unstructured data, for which Pig is considered advantageous.

|> Pig - is a procedural language for developing parallel processing applications for large data sets 
in the Hadoop environment. Pig is an alternative to Java programming for MapReduce, and automatically
generates MapReduce functions. Pig includes Pig Latin, which is a scripting language. Pig translates
Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce, which can then run on YARN and process data in the HDFS cluster. 
Pig is popular because it automates some of the complexity in MapReduce development.
Pig is commonly used for complex use cases that require multiple data operations. It is more of a 
processing language than a query language. Pig helps develop applications that aggregate and sort
data and supports multiple inputs and exports. It is highly customizable, because users can write
their own functions using their preferred scripting language. Ruby, Python and even Java are all 
supported. Thus, Pig has been a popular option for developers that are familiar with those languages 
but not with MapReduce. However, SQL developers may find Hive easier to learn.
