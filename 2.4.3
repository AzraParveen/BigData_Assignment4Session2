REASONS TO LEARN BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES -


>Cost reduction-Big data technologies such as Hadoop and cloud-based analytics bring significant cost
advantages when it comes to storing large amounts of data – plus they can identify more efficient ways
of doing business.

>Faster, better decision making- With the speed of Hadoop and in-memory analytics, combined with the ability
to analyze new sources of data, businesses are able to analyze information immediately – and make decisions
based on what they’ve learned.

>New products and services- With the ability to gauge customer needs and satisfaction through analytics comes
the power to give customers what they want. Davenport points out that with big data analytics, more companies
are creating new products to meet customers’ needs.



With Big Data databases, enterprises can save money, grow revenue, and achieve many other business objectives, 
in any vertical.

> Build new applications: 
Big data might allow a company to collect billions of real-time data points on its products,resources, or customers –
and then repackage that data instantaneously to optimize customer experience or resource utilization.

> Improve the effectiveness and lower the cost of existing applications:
Big data technologies can replace highly-customized, expensive legacy systems with a standard solution that runs on 
commodity hardware. And because many bigdata technologies are open source, they can be implemented far more cheaply 
than proprietary technologies.

> Realize new sources of competitive advantage:
Big data can help businesses act more nimbly, allowing them to adapt to 
changes faster than their competitors.

> Increase customer loyalty: 
Increasing the amount of data shared within the organization – and the speed with which it is updated – allows businesses
and other organizations to more rapidly and accurately respond to customer demand.
